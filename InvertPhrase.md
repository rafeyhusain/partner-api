# Instructions for Running and Compiling

Follow these steps to compile and run the Java program that inverts a phrase while maintaining word order and respecting punctuation marks.

## 1. Compile the Java Code

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `InvertPhrase.java` file, and run the following command to compile the code:

```bash
javac InvertPhrase.java
```

## 2. Run the Compiled Code
After compiling successfully, run the following command to execute the Java program:

```bash
java InvertPhrase
```

This will run the program with the default input phrase "Good afternoon" and print the inverted output.

## 3. Modify Input
You can modify the inputPhrase variable in the main method of the InvertPhrase.java file with your desired input phrase.

```bash
public class InvertPhrase {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String inputPhrase = "Your modified input phrase here";
        // ...
    }
}
```

## 4. Test with Examples
Try the provided examples or create your own phrases to see how the program inverts them while maintaining word order and respecting punctuation marks.
